# Douglas-Peucker-algorithm-in-2-ways
I am going to implement the classical Douglas-Peucker algorithm and a deformed version of the line simplification algorithm.
In this report, I have implemented two different line simplification algorithm: the classical Douglas algorithm, which makes sure the fidelity of curve but it takes more runtime and larger storage for data; and the VL method makes sure simply coding and its fast runtime, however it is not as accurate as Douglas algorithm.
